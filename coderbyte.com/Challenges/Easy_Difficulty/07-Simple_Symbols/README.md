# Simple Symbols

## Question
Using the JavaScript language, have the function `SimpleSymbols(str)` take the `str` parameter being passed and determine if it is an acceptable sequence by either returning the string <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>.
The `str` parameter will be composed of <b>+</b> and <b>=</b> symbols with several letters between them (<b>ie.</b> ++d+===+c++==a) and for the string to be true each letter must be surrounded by a <b>+</b> symbol.
So the string to the left would be false.
The string will not be empty and will have at least one letter.
