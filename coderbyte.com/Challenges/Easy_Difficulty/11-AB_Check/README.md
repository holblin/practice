# AB Check

## Question
Using the JavaScript language, have the function `ABCheck(str)` take the `str` parameter being passed and return the string true if the characters <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are separated by exactly 3 places anywhere in the string at least once (<b>ie.</b> "lane borrowed" would result in true because there is exactly three characters between <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>).
Otherwise return the string false.
