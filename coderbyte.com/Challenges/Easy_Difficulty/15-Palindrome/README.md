# Palindrome
 
## Question
Using the JavaScript language, have the function `Palindrome(str)` take the `str` parameter being passed and return the string <b>true</b> if the parameter is a palindrome, (the string is the same forward as it is backward) otherwise return the string <b>false</b>.
For example: "racecar" is also "racecar" backwards.
Punctuation and numbers will not be part of the string.
