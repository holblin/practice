# Arith Geo

## Question
Using the JavaScript language, have the function `ArithGeo(arr)` take the array of numbers stored in `arr` and return the string <b>"Arithmetic"</b> if the sequence follows an arithmetic pattern or return <b>"Geometric"</b> if it follows a geometric pattern.
If the sequence doesn't follow either pattern return <b>-1</b>.
An arithmetic sequence is one where the difference between each of the numbers is consistent, where as in a geometric sequence, each term after the first is multiplied by some constant or common ratio.
Arithmetic example: [2, 4, 6, 8] and Geometric example: [2, 6, 18, 54].
Negative numbers may be entered as parameters, 0 will not be entered, and no array will contain all the same elements.
