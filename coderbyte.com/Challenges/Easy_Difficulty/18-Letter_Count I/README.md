# Letter Count I

## Question
Using the JavaScript language, have the function `LetterCountI(str)` take the `str` parameter being passed and return the first word with the greatest number of repeated letters.
For example: "Today, is the greatest day ever!" should return <b>greatest</b> because it has 2 e's (and 2 t's) and it comes before <b>ever</b> which also has 2 e's.
If there are no words with repeating letters return <b>-1</b>. Words will be separated by spaces.
